.. admonition:: What should be here

    This page should describe where this event takes place.
    You should mention the address, including city and everything.

    A nice google map pointing to the spot like this is a nice touch.

    Also a good idea:

    * How to get there using public transportation
    * How to get there by car
    * Parking availability
    * Places to eat during lunch breaks
    * A reminder of the rough schedule (start/finish/breaks)
    * Hints about accomodations for those who need to stay overnight
    
My Little Python Meeting takes place at the Royal Albert Hall, located at Kensington Gore, 
London SW7 2AP, United Kingdom, on January 32nd, 2022.

You can get there by many different bus lines. The closest underground station is 
South Kensington in the District Line, located 800 meters away.

There is absolutely no place to park, so arriving by car is insane (just kidding, this is an
example, kids).

Sessions start at 9AM and end at 5PM with a lunch break between 12:30 and 13:30.
Remember that registration is at 8:30 AM so arrive early.

During the lunch break, cucumber sandwiches will be provided for free. 
If you feel more adventurous, there is a number of restaurants nearby.

In case you need to stay overnight, accomodations can be arranged in Hyde Park 
benches.

You create news using ``nikola new_post``. This will create a RSS feed, which I suggest
you mirror into twitter using something like `twitterfeed.com <http://twitterfeed.com>`_

That way you can use the nice twitter widgets in your front page and display the news there.

You can edit and remove posts by just editing the contents of ``posts/``. For example,
it is probably a very good idea to remove this one before launching your event!

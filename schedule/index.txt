.. admonition:: What should be here

   A reminder of time and location (linked to the right page) and of course,
   a detailed schedule. I suggest embedding a google calendar (example shown: 
   english premier league) because it lets people add sessions to their own
   calendar in their phones.
   
   Usually, a disclaimer mentioning things can change and to check back before
   the event.

My Little Python Meeting takes place in `Royal Albert Hall, London </location/>`_
in January 32ns 2022, and it includes sessions spread in two tracks.

Please remember that dates and times can change up to the very day of the meeting,
so check back before you arrive.

For more information about the speakers, check our `speakers page </speakers/>`_
